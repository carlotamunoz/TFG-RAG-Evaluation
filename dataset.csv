Here, it proved eﬀective to focus on the price and the size. We could also look at additional properties, such as the number of rooms, the height of the ceiling, the type of ﬂoor, the geo-location coordinates, and so on. After deciding on a set of features, we create a feature extraction function that maps a real world object (i.e., an apartment) to a vector of measurable quantities (price and size) which can be used as inputs to our models. \ue000e choice of the features is crucial to the success of the classiﬁcation accuracy, and is driven by the informativeness of the features, and their availability to us (the geo-location coordinates are much better predictors of the neighborhood than the price and size, but perhaps we only observe listings of past transactions, and do not have access to the geo-location information). When we have two features, it is easy to plot the data and see the underlying structures.

If we do not care about the relative positions of the words within the window, we will encode the window as a sum: a d. If we do care about the relative positions, we rather use concatenation: (cid:140)a d(cid:141).

36,Who are A. Bilmes and Kirchhoff and what is their contribution to language modeling?,"['9.3.1 FURTHER READING Language modeling is a very vast topic, with decades of research. A good, formal overview of the task, as well as motivations behind the perplexity measure can be found in the class notes by Michael Collins.⁴ A good overview and empirical evaluation of smoothing techniques can be found in the works of Chen and Goodman [1999] and Goodman [2001]. Another review of traditional language modeling techniques can be found in the background chapters of the Ph.D. thesis of Mikolov [2012]. For a recent advance in non-neural language modeling, see Pelemans et al. [2016]. Language modeling approaches based on smoothed MLE estimates (“traditional”) are easy to train, scale to large corpora, and work well in practice. \ue000ey do, however, have several important shortcomings. \ue000e smoothing techniques are intricate and based on back oﬀ to lower-order events. \ue000is assumes a ﬁxed backing-up order, that needs to be designed by hand, and makes it hard to add more “creative” conditioning contexts (i.e., if one wants to condition on the k previous words and on the genre of the text, should the backoﬀ ﬁrst discard of the kth previous word, or of the genre variable?). \ue000e sequential nature of the backoﬀ also makes it hard to scale toward larger ngrams in order to capture long-range dependencies: in order to capture a dependency between the next word and the word 10 positions in the past, one needs to see a relevant 11-gram in the text. In practice, this very rarely happens, and the model backs oﬀ from the long history. It could be that a better option would be to back oﬀ from the intervening words, i.e., allow for ngrams with “holes” in them. However, these are tricky to deﬁne while retaining a proper generative probabilistic framework.⁵ Scaling to larger ngrams is an inherent problem for MLE-based language models. \ue000e na- ture of natural language and the large number of words in the vocabulary means that statistics for larger ngrams will be sparse. Moreover, scaling to larger ngrams is very expensive in terms of n: increasing memory requirements. \ue000e number of possible ngrams over a vocabulary V is j the order by one will result in a -fold increase to that number.

We may also replace or supplement words by distributional features such as word clusters or word-embedding vectors. When using a linear classiﬁer, we may want to also consider word pairs, i.e., consider each pairofwords(notnecessarilyconsecutive)thatappearinthesamedocumentasacorefeature.\ue000is will result in a huge number of potential core features, and the number will need to be trimmed down by designing some heuristic, such as considering only word pairs which appear in a speciﬁed number of documents. Nonlinear classiﬁers alleviate this need. When using a bag-of-words, it is sometimes useful to weight each word with proportion to its informativeness, for example using TF-IDF weighting (Section 6.2.1). However, the learning algorithm is often capable of coming up with the weighting on its own. Another option is to use word indicators rather than word counts: each word in the document (or each word above a given count) will be represented once, regardless of its number of occurrences in the document. In the authorship attribution task [Koppel et al., 2009] we are given a text and need to infer the identify of its author (from a ﬁxed set of possible authors), or other characteristics of the author of the text, such as their gender, their age or their native language. \ue000e kind of information used to solve this task is very diﬀerent than that of topic classiﬁcation—the clues are subtle, and involve stylistic properties of the text rather than con- tent words. \ue000us, our choice of features should shy away from content words and focus on more stylistic properties.² A good set for such tasks focus on parts of speech (POS) tags and function words. \ue000ese are words like on, of, the, and, before and so on that do not carry much content on their own but rather serve to connect to content-bearing words and assign meanings to their compositions, as well as pronouns (he, she, I, they, etc.) A good approximation of function words is the list of top- 300 or so most frequent words in a large corpus. By focusing on such features, we can learn to capture subtle stylistic variations in writing, that are unique to an author and very hard to fake. A good feature set for authorship attribution task include a bag-of-function-words-and- pronouns, bag-of-POS-tags, and bags of POS bigrams, trigrams, and 4grams. Additionally, we may want to consider the density of function words (i.e., the ratio between the number of function words and content words in a window of text), a bag of bigrams of function words after removing the content words, and the distributions of the distances between consecutive function words. ²One could argue that for age or gender identiﬁcation, we may as well observe also the content-words, as there are strong correlation between age and gender of a person and the topics they write about and the language register they use. \ue000is is generally true, but if we are interested in a forensic or adversarial setting in which the author has an incentive to hide their age or gender, we better not rely on content-based features, as these are rather easy to fake, compared to the more subtle stylistic cues.']","To infer an author's identity or other characteristics such as gender or age from a text, a good feature set should focus on parts of speech (POS) tags and function words.

44,What factors contribute to the success of classification accuracy when using linear models and deep learning?,"['<1-hop>\n\n2. LEARNING BASICS AND LINEAR MODELS', '<2-hop>\n\nFeature Representations In the example above, each data-point was a pair of size and price measurements. Each of these properties is considered a feature by which we classify the data- point. \ue000is is very convenient, but in most cases the data-points are not given to us directly as lists of features, but as real-world objects. For example, in the apartments example we may be given a list of apartments to classify. We then need to make a concious decision and select the measurable properties of the apartments that we believe will be useful features for the classiﬁcation task at hand. Here, it proved eﬀective to focus on the price and the size. We could also look at additional properties, such as the number of rooms, the height of the ceiling, the type of ﬂoor, the geo-location coordinates, and so on. After deciding on a set of features, we create a feature extraction function that maps a real world object (i.e., an apartment) to a vector of measurable quantities (price and size) which can be used as inputs to our models. \ue000e choice of the features is crucial to the success of the classiﬁcation accuracy, and is driven by the informativeness of the features, and their availability to us (the geo-location coordinates are much better predictors of the neighborhood than the price and size, but perhaps we only observe listings of past transactions, and do not have access to the geo-location information). When we have two features, it is easy to plot the data and see the underlying structures. However, as we see in the next example, we often use many more than just two features, making plotting and precise reasoning impractical. A central part in the design of linear models, which we mostly gloss over in this text, is the design of the feature function (so called feature engineering). One of the promises of deep learning is that it vastly simpliﬁes the feature-engineering process by allowing the model designer to specify a small set of core, basic, or “natural” features, and letting the trainable neural network architecture combine them into more meaningful higher-level features, or representations. However, one still needs to specify a suitable set of core features, and tie them to a suitable architecture. We discuss common features for textual data in Chapters 6 and 7. We usually have many more than two features. Moving to a language setup, consider the task of distinguishing documents written in English from documents written in German. It turns out that letter frequencies make for quite good predictors (features) for this task. Even more informative are counts of letter bigrams, i.e., pairs of consecutive letters.⁷ Assuming we have an alphabet of 28 letters (a–z, space, and a special symbol for all other characters including digits, R784, where punctuations, etc.) we represent a document as a 28 each entry x(cid:140)i(cid:141) represents a count of a particular letter combination in the document, normalized by the document’s length. For example, denoting by xab the entry of x corresponding to the ⁷While one may think that words will also be good predictors, letters, or letter-bigrams are far more robust: we are likely to encounter a new document without any of the words we observed in the training set, while a document without any of the distinctive letter-bigrams is signiﬁcantly less likely.']","The success of classification accuracy when using linear models and deep learning is driven by two main factors. First, the choice of features is crucial, as it determines the informativeness and availability of the data used for classification. In the context provided, it was shown that focusing on price and size proved effective, but additional properties such as the number of rooms, height of the ceiling, type of floor, geo-location coordinates, etc., could also be considered.

If we do not care about the relative positions of the words within the window, we will encode the window as a sum: a d. If we do care about the relative positions, we rather use concatenation: (cid:140)a d(cid:141). Here, even though a word will have the same vector regard- less of its position within the window, the word’s position is reﬂected by its position within the concatenation.² 2; we need to encode the words at positions i We may not care much about the order, but would want to consider words further away from the context word less than words that are closer to it. \ue000is can be encoded as a weighted sum, i.e., 1 \ue000ese encodings can be mixed and matched. Assume we care if the feature occurs before or after the focus word, but do not care about the distance as long as it is within the window. \ue000is can be encoded using a combination of summation and concatenation: (cid:140).a A note on notation When describing network layers that get concatenated vectors x, y, and z as input, some authors use explicit concatenation ((cid:140)x b) while others use an aﬃne trans- b/. If the weight matrices U, V , W in the aﬃne transformation formation (xU are diﬀerent³ than one another, the two notations are equivalent. Feed-forward networks assume a ﬁxed dimensional input. \ue000is can easily accommodate the case of a feature-extraction function that extracts a ﬁxed number of features: each feature is represented as a vector, and the vectors are concatenated. \ue000is way, each region of the resulting input vector corresponds to a diﬀerent feature. However, in some cases the number of features is not known in advance (for example, in document classiﬁcation it is common that each word in the sentence is a feature). We thus need to represent an unbounded number of features using a ﬁxed size vector. One way of achieving this is through a so-called continuous bag of words (CBOW) representation [Mikolov et al., 2013b].\ue000e CBOW is very similar to the traditional bag-of-words representation in which we discard order information, and works by either summing or averaging the embedding ²Alternatively, we could have a separate embedding for each word/position pair, i.e., a1 and a(cid:0) when it appears in relative positions sensitive to position information: a(cid:0) C of words when they appear in diﬀerent positions, and may be harder to use with externally trained word vectors. ³\ue000e matrices should be diﬀerent in the sense that a change to one will not be reﬂected in the others. It is OK for the matrices to happen to share the same values, of course. 2 will represent the word a 2, respectively.

Next, they would design the architecture of the neural network, specifying the number of layers, nodes in each layer, and activation functions. Then, they would initialize the weights and biases of the network using appropriate methods such as He initialization or Xavier initialization. After that, they would train the network using an optimization algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. During training, they would use a loss function to measure the error between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.

67,"How can we encode a window of words for document classification using continuous bag of words (CBOW) representation, considering the position information?","['<1-hop>\n\n8.2.1', '<2-hop>\n\nWINDOW-BASED FEATURES Consider the case of encoding a window of size k words to each side of a focus word at position i. Assume k 2. As- sume the window items are the words a, b, c, and d, and let a,b,c and d be the corresponding word vectors. If we do not care about the relative positions of the words within the window, we will encode the window as a sum: a d. If we do care about the relative positions, we rather use concatenation: (cid:140)a d(cid:141). Here, even though a word will have the same vector regard- less of its position within the window, the word’s position is reﬂected by its position within the concatenation.² 2; we need to encode the words at positions i We may not care much about the order, but would want to consider words further away from the context word less than words that are closer to it. \ue000is can be encoded as a weighted sum, i.e., 1 \ue000ese encodings can be mixed and matched. Assume we care if the feature occurs before or after the focus word, but do not care about the distance as long as it is within the window. \ue000is can be encoded using a combination of summation and concatenation: (cid:140).a A note on notation When describing network layers that get concatenated vectors x, y, and z as input, some authors use explicit concatenation ((cid:140)x b) while others use an aﬃne trans- b/. If the weight matrices U, V , W in the aﬃne transformation formation (xU are diﬀerent³ than one another, the two notations are equivalent. Feed-forward networks assume a ﬁxed dimensional input. \ue000is can easily accommodate the case of a feature-extraction function that extracts a ﬁxed number of features: each feature is represented as a vector, and the vectors are concatenated. \ue000is way, each region of the resulting input vector corresponds to a diﬀerent feature. However, in some cases the number of features is not known in advance (for example, in document classiﬁcation it is common that each word in the sentence is a feature). We thus need to represent an unbounded number of features using a ﬁxed size vector. One way of achieving this is through a so-called continuous bag of words (CBOW) representation [Mikolov et al., 2013b].\ue000e CBOW is very similar to the traditional bag-of-words representation in which we discard order information, and works by either summing or averaging the embedding ²Alternatively, we could have a separate embedding for each word/position pair, i.e., a1 and a(cid:0) when it appears in relative positions sensitive to position information: a(cid:0) C of words when they appear in diﬀerent positions, and may be harder to use with externally trained word vectors. ³\ue000e matrices should be diﬀerent in the sense that a change to one will not be reﬂected in the others. It is OK for the matrices to happen to share the same values, of course. 2 will represent the word a 2, respectively. Following this approach, we could then use a sum and still be 2. \ue000is approach will not share information between instances']","To encode a window of words for document classification using the continuous bag of words (CBOW) representation while considering position information, we can sum or average the embedding vectors of each word in the window. This approach discards order information but represents the word based on its position within the window. For example, if the window contains the words 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' at positions i, we would encode it as a sum: a + b + c + d or as an average: (a + b + c + d) / 4. This way, each region of the resulting input vector corresponds to a different feature, with the position of the word within the window reflected by its position within the sum or average.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer

73,"How do neural networks handle feature extraction and combination compared to traditional linear-model-based NLP systems, and what are the advantages of using neural network models over kernel methods for training large datasets?","['<1-hop>\n\nFROM TEXTUAL FEATURES TO INPUTS Note that the feature extraction stage in the neural network settings deals only with extraction of core features. \ue000is is in contrast to the traditional linear-model-based NLP systems in which the feature designer had to manually specify not only the core features of interest but also interactions between them (e.g., introducing not only a feature stating “word is X” and a feature stating “tag is Y” but also combined feature stating “word is X and tag is Y” or sometimes even “word is X, tag is Y and previous word is Z”). \ue000e combination features are crucial in linear models because they introduce more dimensions to the input, transforming it into a space where the data-points are closer to being linearly separable. On the other hand, the space of possible combinations is very large, and the feature designer has to spend a lot of time coming up with an eﬀective set of feature combinations. One of the promises of the nonlinear neural network models is that one needs to deﬁne only the core features. \ue000e nonlinearity of the classiﬁer, as deﬁned by the network structure, is expected to take care of ﬁnding the indicative feature combinations, alleviating the need for feature combination engineering. As discussed in Section 3.3, kernel methods [Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004], and in particular polynomial kernels [Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003], also allow the feature designer to specify only core features, leaving the feature combination aspect to the learning algorithm. In contrast to neural network models, kernels methods are convex, admitting exact solutions to the optimizationproblem.However,thecomputationalcomplexityofclassiﬁcationinkernelmethods scaleslinearlywiththesizeofthetrainingdata,makingthemtooslowformostpracticalpurposes, andnotsuitablefortrainingwithlargedatasets.Ontheotherhand,thecomputationalcomplexity of classiﬁcation using neural networks scales linearly with the size of the network, regardless of the training data size.⁶ Consider a case where you have a few features that share the same vocabulary. For example, when assigning a part-of-speech to a given word, we may have a set of features considering the previous word, and a set of features considering the next word. When building the input to the classiﬁer, we will concatenate the vector representation of the previous word to the vector representation of the next word. \ue000e classiﬁer will then be able to distinguish the two diﬀerent indicators, and treat them diﬀerently. But should the two features share the same vectors? Should the vector for “dog:previous-word” be the same as the vector of “dog:next-word”? Or should we assign them two distinct vectors? \ue000is, again, is mostly an empirical question. If you believe words behave diﬀerently when they appear in diﬀerent positions (e.g., word X behaves like word Y when in the previous position, but X behaves like Z when in the next position) then it may be a good idea to use two diﬀerent vocabularies and assign a diﬀerent set of vectors for each feature type. However, ⁶Of course, one still needs to go over the entire dataset when training, and sometimes go over the dataset several times. \ue000is makes training time scale linearly with the dataset size. However, each example, in either training or test time, is processed in a constant time (for a given network). \ue000is is in contrast to a kernel classiﬁer, in which each example is processed in a time that scales linearly with the dataset size.']","Neural networks handle feature extraction and combination differently than traditional linear-model-based NLP systems.
